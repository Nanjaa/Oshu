	// 	As an android, I have a choice: repair my parts and live as long as possible, or make use of a program that will terminate me after a set amount of time. 
	// 	I have chosen the latter. I wanted to be as human as possible, to feel like I really belonged to my family. My time has almost come to an end, and I can see 
	// 	my internal clock depleting quickly. However, there are still many things I wish to see and do before I pass. Ive made a list of the experiences I crave most, 
	// 	and now set out to complete that list. I dont have much time, but Im excited that my last hours will be beautiful, and full of rich and wonderful memories.'
